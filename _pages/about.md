<b>Introduction</b> <br>
I'm Shelby. I'm originally from Maryland 🦀 and I now live in Silicon Valley. I recently finished my PhD focusing on [theoretical machine learning at UIC](https://theory.cs.uic.edu/), where I was advised by [Lev Reyzin](http://levreyzin.com){:target="\_blank"}. I am currently a Research Scientist 👩🏽‍🔬 at [Salesforce Research](http://einstein.ai){:target="\_blank"} working on both fundamental research and product applications.

I started my graduate school journey pursuing pure mathematics. Inspired by internship [experiences](https://shelbyheinecke.github.io/website/experience/), I transitioned to theoretical computer science and machine learning.

<b>Research</b><br>
In my thesis work, I focused on problems related to network science and [PAC learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning) in distributed settings. I'm currently expanding my research vision. Lately, I've been working on problems related to recommendation systems.

Outside of work, I like to hike ⛰, play [Civilization 6](https://civilization.com/), read, and have fun with my husband and cat. I also enjoy teaching and mentoring.
