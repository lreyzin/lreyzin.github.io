I am a Professor of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science and the Director of the Foundations of Data Science Institute at UIC.
My research spans the theory and practice of machine learning. Prior to coming to UIC, I was a Simons Postdoctoral Fellow at Georgia Tech,
and before that, an NSF CI-Fellow at Yahoo! Research.
I received my Ph.D. on an NSF graduate research fellowship from Yale under Dana Angluin and my undergraduate degree from Princeton.
I serve on the board of the Association for Algorithmic Learning Theory, as an Associate Editor of Ann. Math. Artif. Intell., and as an Editorial Board Reviewer for J. Mach. Learn. Res.
Recently, I was program chair for ALT 2017 and ISAIM 2020.
My work has earned awards at ICML, COLT, and AISTATS and has been funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense.
